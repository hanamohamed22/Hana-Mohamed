        <li>When you open HeavySet you'll find most everything is made just to delight you.

Let's start with data entry. The buttons are just where they need to be and big enough not to miss even with shaking legs — or hands. What's more, you typically only have to tap once to log a set; HeavySet's smart predictions have already accomplished the, umm, heavy lifting.

HeavySet's smarts do not mean you give up any control over setting up routines. Routine can be entered the way they work best for you: you can specify rep ranges, pick weight based on intensity (in percent of your calculated 1 rep max) or define supersets and giant sets. The notable exception are drop sets.

HeavySet is the best workout log app overall.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Strong comes with all the tools you'll need to keep track of your workouts in a very effective manner: a large library of exercises and a functional way to enter data.

Adding sets and exercises is as fast as removing or re-arranging them; for each exercise, you get the previous workout data to enter fast as well as the complete history, charts and records; the rest timer is wisely integrated in the keyboard (if you don't have it start automatically), and the NEXT button is right there as well.

Strong includes a plate calculator as well. However, it might not be so useful as you cannot define your own bar weight (the olympic bar is there, though). The warm-up calculator a bit oddly only works for barbell exercises.

Just picking exercises as you go is easy, but Strong lets you combine them into routines as well. Unfortunately, scheduling these, picking days or just organizing them in folders is not possible, so you always have to hunt a bit for the right workout or constantly re-arrange for the most-used to be on top. For both exercises and body measurements, Strong presents pretty and helpful charts.

All in all, Strong is a really good app for planning and logging workout</li>

      <li>Instead of letting you plan and log workouts, maybe with a few standard routines already set up, Fitbod aims to be a coach and trainer more than a mere log book. It is not unreasonable or inflexible about it, though, and the approach is sane enough.

Based on muscle fatigue by group (derived from your previous sessions), Fitbod will suggest a workout of the day, all with suggested sets, rep counts and weights based on A. S. Prilepin's famous powerlifting chart. Swapping exercises that target the same muscles is easy, but you can also customize each workout freely. Fitbod comes with a big library of exercises that includes descriptions and videos with proper form.

Because the suggested workout can be customized to your liking as well, you can pick the desired length, specify exactly which equipment you have at hand (yay!), whether to go, say, for maximum hypertrophy or powerlifting strength — and which exercises to exclude. It would be sweet if Fitbod let you save gym profiles with available equipment.

As a workout log, Fitbod fares not all that well. Entering workouts is easy enough, thanks to Fitbod's planning smarts, and the app uses the data well. What you get to see is a mere calendar log and heat map, though; no charts, records or the like.

So, Fitbod is a bit out of its place in this list — and well worth a try. Your body will love it.</li>
