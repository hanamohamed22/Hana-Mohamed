  <p id="bold">The role of women in society has been greatly overseen in the last few decades but now are coming to a more perspective to people.
     In the early days women were seen as wives who were intended to cook, clean,
      and take care of the kids. They were not allowed to vote while men took care of having jobs and paying any bills that had to be paid. </p>
      <p>       Soon enough it caught on that women should have a bigger role than what other people thought women should have.
        Women would have strikes and go on marches to prove that they should have rights just like everyone else.</p>
        <p id="optical">They faced discrimination like and other race that faced it.
           Women would voice their opinion in any way possible so that they could reach their goal and they did.</p>
